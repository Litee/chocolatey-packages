# Chocolatey

Chocolatey is the nice way to install apps and keep them up-to-date under Windows OS - see https://chocolatey.org/ for more details. I love the project, so decided to contribute by supporting several packages. If you see that there is a new version of any packages - ping me via GitHub issues or via "Contact Maintainer" link at Chocolatey web site.
